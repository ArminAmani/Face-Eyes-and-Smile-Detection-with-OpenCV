# Face-Eyes-and-Smile-Detection-with-OpenCV
In this Project We learn how to detect Face, Eyes and Smile with OpenCV from Webcam.

This project uses Haar-like features to detect faces, eyes, and smiles. It is done in Python and uses the open source computer vision library OpenCV.

For installation, documentation, and to get familiar with OpenCV, please visit the official OpenCV GitHub repository:

If you don't have an internal webcam and you want to use an external webcam simply change the parameter of the cv.VideoCapture() function from 0 to 1.
